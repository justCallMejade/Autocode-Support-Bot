# Autocode-Support-Bot

Hey! Thanks for checking and reading this out. This Support Bot is made by justCallMeJade, founder of Jade Studios. A Support Bot is a support ticketing system that creates a restricted channel in your server each time a user opens a ticket using slash commands, allowing for quick communication and support.

### How to use this bot?
Its simple, server members can create a ticket using the slash command: `/open-ticket`. The bot will open a text channel that only allows the user, who opened a ticket, to view and interact with it.
The bot will mention the user to the text channel for a quick setup. This setup helps the user to determine the specific staff team to involve.

Then, the ticket is now visible on the staff team. The staff team can claim the ticket to restrict other staff members, allowing the users to have a private conversation.

## Commands
The bot uses slash commands, no prefix needed.
[]- Required    ()- Optional
### User Commands
#### /open-ticket
Allows the user to open a ticket to talk about its issues or concerns.
### Staff Commands
#### /close-ticket [reason]
Closes the ticket temporarily and opens a prompt for re-open or deletion of the ticket.

## Thanks!
